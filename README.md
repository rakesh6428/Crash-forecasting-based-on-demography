Analysis of Road Accidents Based on Demography and Accident Forecasting

Road traffic safety is a measure that is often not given the due care that is needed. The
knowledge of road safety should be taught starting from school. As per the reports by world
health organization, there are almost 1.25 million deaths a year across the globe because of
the negligence on road while driving leading to traffic accidents. With such a high fatality
rate, accidents are predominant in developing countries than in undeveloped countries. The
United Nation and rest of the world is seriously concerned about reducing the traffic
accidents and decreasing the fatality rate.
Prevention of accidents could possibly be a complex research problem to address
since it involves multiple parameters(internal such as vehicle age etc. and external parameters
such as weather and road conditions). There is a huge scope for making meaningful analysis
of the crash data and predicting/forecasting the accident based on the demographics such as
location, vehicle type, driver age, weather, geo location.
Current advancements in the field of machine learning gives us ways to process multidimensional
data, build a model that forecasts accidents based on the data provided to the
model. The key factor to consider is, how accurate is our model and how much room for error
we have in our predictions.
